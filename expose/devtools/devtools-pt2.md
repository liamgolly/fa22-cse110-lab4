1. The bug was that the sum function is passing in two strings, so the addition is performing string concat instead of addition.
2. To fix this, we can call parseInt(num1, 10) and parseInt(num2, 10) to convert the numbers to integers, convincing javascript to do numerical math instead of string concatination.
